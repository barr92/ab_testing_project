# A/B Testing Project

This project exemplifies the skills that I cultivated through my academic studies and professional experiences as a data analyst.

In this project, I developed a highly efficient function for analysing the statistical significance between different test groups on a website. Furthermore, I meticulously examined the dataset to identify and address outliers. I employed various data visualization techniques, including the utilization of libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, to create informative visual representations such as boxplots and histograms.

Additionally, I harnessed the power of Plotly to create comprehensive visualizations of the product sales funnel. These visualizations helped me gain valuable insights into user conversion patterns on the website.

This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis but also showcases my ability to communicate complex findings in a clear and professional manner.
